# Simple GUI Example in Java

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates the creation of a basic graphical user interface (GUI) using the Swing library. The program consists of a window with a button, and when the button is clicked, a message dialog is displayed.

## Usage

1. Save the Java code in a file with the `.java` extension (e.g., `SimpleGUI.java`).
2. Compile the code using a Java compiler.
   ```bash
   javac SimpleGUI.java
   ```

3. Run the compiled program
   ```bahs
   java SimpleGUI
   ```

## Description
The main components of the code include:

- JFrame: The main window of the GUI.
- JButton: A clickable button.
- ActionListener: An event listener for the button click event.
- JOptionPane: A dialog box for displaying messages.
